# Jet Flavour Classification

This project aims to classify heavy-flavour jets at LHCb using graph neural networks (GNNs). Currently, we have four classifiers
- b vs q
- c vs b
- c vs q
- b/c vs q

## Setting Up Environment

Use Python version 3.9.0, since PyTorch Geometric is incompatable with the most recent versions.
Install the following packages to your environment:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
pip install torchaudio
pip install torch-geometric
pip install networkx
pip install scikit-learn
pip install seaborn
```

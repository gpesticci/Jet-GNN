# Jet Flavour Classification

This project aims to classify heavy-flavour jets at LHCb using graph neural networks (GNNs). Currently, we have four classifiers:
- b vs q
- c vs b
- c vs q
- b/c vs q

## Setting Up Environment

Use Python version 3.9.0, since PyTorch Geometric is incompatable with the most recent versions. Conda environment, gnn_env, is attached.

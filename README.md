# Jet Flavour Classification

The goal of this project is to develop a graph neural network to classify jets. Currently, we have four classifiers for b,c, and q-jets.

## Setting Up Environment

Use Python version 3.9.0, since PyTorch Geometric is incompatable with the most recent versions.
Install the following packages to your environment:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
pip install torchaudio
pip install torch-geometric
pip install networkx
pip install scikit-learn
pip install seaborn
```
